## Workshops

This is a tentative list of workshops. Please add an issue if you have any suggestions

[Workshop 1: Practical Intro to Binance Chain](practical-guide-binance-chain.md)

-   Before we dive into the technicals, let's use the technology from the perspective of the end user
-   We'll create a wallet and load it with BNB
-   We'll use the BNB to trade for BUSD
-   We'll explain why it's difficult to build a Decentralized Exchange, and why Binance Chain has chosen to take this route of creating our own chain

[Workshop 2: Programmable Money, and your first Transaction](programmable-money-transaction.md)

-   We'll use BUSD we traded for in the last workshop, this time programmatically using the Javascript SDK
-   We'll execute a trade programmatically, directly to the DEX

[Workshop 3: Launching an e-money Stablecoin on Binance Chain](launching-emoney-stablecoin.md)

-   We'll create a BEP-2 stablecoin on the Binance Chain testnet, using the command line interface
-   We'll go through the minting process

[Workshop 4: Listing an e-money Stablecoin on Binance Chain](listing-emoney-stablecoin.md)

-   We'll list the e-money Stablecoin on Binance Chain

[Workshop 5: Building a simple block explorer for Binance Chain](building-block-explorer.md)

-   We'll learn how to use go and amino to retrieve data from Binance Chain
-   We'll learn about the AVL tree data structure that Binance Chain uses

[Workshop 6: Listing an Ethereum ERC-20 token on Binance DEX](list-bep3-token.md)

-   We use Hashed Timelocked Contracts and Atomic Swaps to list an ethereum ERC-20 token on Binance Chain
